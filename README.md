# social-media-project

This project was for a class at NJIT. It was a group project with Atharv Tyagi, Joseph Santantonio, and Nikhil Shah.

Our assignment was to create a social media website on a public hosting site. We used Heroku and based our website backend in Java. For our frontend, we used HTTP, CSS, Java, and Javascript. 

We created HobbyHome to allow for people to gather and talk about various hobbies that they are passionate about.
